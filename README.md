This is a demonstration of the tools at hand for AI chat bot generation that I have done as a side project to show some of the capabilities.

It creates a simple form to send in a request for an issue and the following consequences happen:

1. Analyses the request into a particular type and based on that sends it to an appropriate channel
2. A human then triages it and gives it a severity warning in Slack
3. The agent then responds and gives step by step advice on how to deal with the issue.
